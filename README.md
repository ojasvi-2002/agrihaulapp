# AgriHaul — Operations Dashboard

A lightweight, single-page web dashboard for agritech companies managing SMS-based farm pickup logistics. No backend server required. Connects directly to Google Sheets as a database and Twilio for SMS dispatch.

---

## What This Is

agritech client logs in here to:

- Review incoming SMS requests, confirm farmers, and assign trucks (Update app, data, tables, add intake.js)
- Monitor 60 trucks on a live map
- View all dispatch history
- Manage farmer and driver registrations
- Trigger manual dispatches if needed

Farmers and drivers never use this app — they interact only via SMS.
No WhatsApp or internet connection is assumed on the farmer side; the
intake format is plain SMS text: `NAME - PRODUCT - QUANTITY - LOCATION`.

---

## How Incoming Requests Work

A farmer texts a structured message and nothing else:

```
NAME - PRODUCT - QUANTITY - LOCATION
KWAME - RED OIL - 200L - AJUMAKO
```

The `Requests` tab in Google Sheets logs the raw message and phone
number the moment it arrives. `js/intake.js` parses it client-side
into name, product, quantity, and location, matches the phone number
against the Farmers sheet, and flags anything that doesn't parse
cleanly (missing field, non-numeric quantity) as "Needs review"
instead of guessing.

From the **Requests** page in the dashboard, ops can:
1. Confirm the request (registers a new farmer automatically if the
   phone number isn't in the Farmers sheet yet)
2. Assign an available truck and dispatch it, which writes a normal
   row to `DispatchLog`

This is the same aggregation pattern as GreenEarth Connect: keep the
farmer side to plain SMS, do all the parsing, validation, and
coordination in the backend.

## Setup Guide (First Time)

### Step 1 — Google Sheets

1. Create a Google Sheet with four tabs:
   - `Farmers` — columns: Name, Phone, Village, Lat, Lon, Registered
   - `Trucks` — columns: TruckID, DriverName, Phone, Status, Lat, Lon, LastUpdated
   - `DispatchLog` — columns: Date, Time, Farmer, Village, WeightKG, Driver, TruckID, DistanceKM
   - `Requests` — columns: Phone, Raw, ReceivedAt (raw inbound SMS, one row per message)

2. Publish the sheet:
   - File → Share → Publish to web → Select each tab → CSV → Publish
   - Copy the published CSV URLs for each tab

3. Open `js/config.js` and paste the URLs into `SHEETS.FARMERS_URL`, `SHEETS.TRUCKS_URL`, `SHEETS.DISPATCH_URL`, and `SHEETS.REQUESTS_URL`

### Step 2 — Twilio

1. Sign up at twilio.com (free trial gives $15 credit)
2. Buy a phone number with SMS capability (~$1/month)
3. Go to Console → Account Info → copy Account SID and Auth Token
4. Open `js/config.js` and fill in `TWILIO.ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO.AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO.FROM_NUMBER`

> ⚠️ Note: Calling Twilio directly from the browser exposes your Auth Token. For production, proxy through a small Cloudflare Worker or Netlify Function. See comments in `js/config.js` for how to do this.

### Step 3 — Make.com Webhook

1. In Make.com, create a scenario: inbound SMS webhook → append row to the Requests tab → (optional) SMS dispatch back to the farmer
2. Copy the webhook URL from your Make.com scenario
3. Paste it into `MAKE.WEBHOOK_URL` in `js/config.js`

### Step 4 — Deploy Free

**Option A — Netlify Drop (zero account)**
1. Zip the entire `agrihaulapp/` folder
2. Go to netlify.com/drop
3. Drag and drop the zip
4. Get a live URL instantly

**Option B — GitHub + Netlify (recommended for ongoing use)**
1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Log in to netlify.com → New site from Git → Connect repo → Deploy
3. Any push to main auto-deploys

**Option C — GitHub Pages**
1. Push to GitHub
2. Settings → Pages → Source: main branch / root
3. Live at `https://yourusername.github.io/agrihaulapp`
